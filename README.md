# Gov-1006-Replication-2

This is Jack Schroeder's replication of "Causal effect of intergroup contact on exclusionary
attitudes" by Prof. Ryan Enos (2014). It was done for Gov 1006: Models.

There are three rmd files in the repo.
The first, "Replication-2-Week-1.Rmd", is the work for the first week of replicating.
It contains the replicated versions of the first two tables in the paper (the code to
replicate the third table was not accessible).
The second, "Replication-2-Week-1-Scratch.Rmd", is the scratch work during replication.
This includes all of Enos' code, but it may not knit.
The third, "Replication-2-Week-2.Rmd", is the work for the second week of replicating.
It contains the extension of Enos' paper.

The htmls in the repo are the knitted versions of each week's replication work.

The folder "Enos Code" includes the Dataverse files downloaded while replicating
the paper.

There is also a gitignore file and this readme.
