# Gov-1006-Replication-2

This is Jack Schroeder's replication of "Causal effect of intergroup contact on exclusionary
attitudes" by Prof. Ryan Enos (2014).

There are two rmd files in the repo.
The first, "Replication-2-Week-1.Rmd", is the work for the first week of replicating.
It contains the replicated versions of the first two tables in the paper (the code to
replicate the third table was not accessible).
The second, "Replication-2-Week-1-Scratch.Rmd", is the scratch work during replication.
This includes all of Enos' code, but it may not knit.

The html in the repo is the knitted version of the first week's replication work.

The folder "Enos Code" includes the Dataverse files downloaded while replicating
the paper.
